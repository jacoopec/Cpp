//with template we write code once and use it for any data type including user defined data types. Sort() can 
//be written and used to sort user defined data types. A class stack can be created that can be used as a 
//stack of any data type.
//with template specialization it is possible to use diefferent code for a particular data type.
//template allows to define generic classes and functions
//templates can be called parametrized classes or functions.
//FUNCTION TEMPLATES
//function templates are used in general to avoid code duplication in overloaded functions.
//a function template allows to write a generic function which is independet of the data type.
