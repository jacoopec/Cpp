# üñ•Ô∏è C++ Programming Experiments

This repository contains a collection of experiments, practice programs, and learning projects written in C++.

The main goals of this repository are:
- Deepen understanding of C++ syntax and standard practices.
- Recreate sorting algorithms from scratch.
- Implement core data structures manually (e.g., linked lists, trees, stacks).
- Experiment with multithreading, futures, and mutexes.
- Study and manually implement key design patterns in C++.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

- Classic sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
- Manual implementation of data structures
- Understanding and applying OOP principles in C++
- Multithreading experiments (threads, mutexes, locks)
- Using std::future and std::async for asynchronous programming
- Manual replication of design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer
- Experimentation with modern C++ features (C++11 and beyond)


üìö 

This project was created solely for learning and personal growth.  
It is not tied to a specific application or project goal.  
It serves as a space to:
- Practice key C++ concepts hands-on
- Revisit complex topics like concurrency and synchronization
- Build a personal reference library of C++ patterns and techniques


- Code examples focus on clarity and practice, not on production optimization.
- Some experiments are intentionally basic or isolated to focus on one concept at a time.
- This repository will continue evolving as new C++ concepts are explored.
